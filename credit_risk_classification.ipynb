    "In this case, the logistic regresseion model using oversampled data does a better job than using the raw, unskewed data. Of the total 18759 total healthy loans, 18668 were correctly identified as healthy, which is a 99.51% accuracy rate, which is approximately the same as the 99.57% accuracy rate using the raw data. Again, the precision and recall were both 100% for healthy loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with using raw data, however, was that the accuracy of predicting the high-risk loans was lower, and around 10% of the loans were incorrectly identified as healthy. Using the random over-sampling method corrected this issue. Out of the 625 high-risk loans, only 2 were misidentified as healthy, leading to a 99.7% accuracy rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recall for high-risk loans was 100%, in line with the recall for healthy loans. However, the precision for high-risk loans is still only 87%, which was the case before the oversampling. This indicates we still have a loans that were healthy that were incorrectly identified as high-risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is definitely an improvement, but it does mean that if this model is to be used, we should pay particularly close attention to high-risk loans. According to this data, there is very little chance that an actually high-risk loan is going to be misidentified as healthy, but there is a significant chance that a loan identified as high-risk will actually be healthy. With this in mind, taking a second look over these applications is warranted, to avoid deterring customers that are likely to pay back the balance of their loan."
